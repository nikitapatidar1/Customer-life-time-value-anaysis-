# Customer-life-time-value-anaysis-
This project analyzes customer transaction data to estimate Customer Lifetime Value (CLV), a metric that helps businesses understand the value a customer brings over the entire relationship with the company. The project uses Python and various data science techniques to calculate CLV, visualize trends, and build predictive models.

#Introduction
The objective of this project is to estimate the lifetime value of customers based on transaction history. Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) is a crucial metric in customer segmentation, marketing budget allocation, and business decision-making. The project employs several methods to calculate CLV, such as:

* Simple Historical CLV
* Predictive models based on RFM analysis (Recency, Frequency, Monetary value)
* Machine learning approaches for CLV prediction.
  
  ##Dataset
   The dataset used in this project contains historical transaction data with the following fields:

     * Customer ID: Unique identifier for each customer
     * Transaction Date: Date of each transaction
     * Transaction Amount: Total value of the transaction
    * Product Category: Product type involved in the transaction
If you'd like to use this data, a sample CSV file is included in the data/ folder. If the dataset is large or sensitive, download it from [link-to-dataset].

##Analysis Approach
The analysis consists of several steps:

1. Data Preprocessing:
  * Handle missing values, remove duplicates
  * Parse dates and filter data for relevant time periods
  * Aggregate data at the customer level
2. RFM Analysis:
   * Group customers based on Recency, Frequency, and Monetary value (RFM)
   *  Categorize customers into segments for better understanding of their lifetime value
3. CLV Calculation:
   * Historical CLV: Based on actual past transactions
    * Predictive CLV: Using machine learning models such as Gamma-Gamma, BG/NBD models
4. Visualization:
  *  Visualize customer segments and CLV distribution across different groups
  *  Plot trends over time, such as average CLV growth or churn rates
5. Machine Learning Models:
   * Train predictive models using features like transaction history, RFM scores, and demographic data (if available)
  *   Model performance evaluation using metrics like R-squared, MAE, etc.
